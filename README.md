Analyzing Honey Data from 1995-2022

This python project analyzes an extensive dataset that contains data pertaining to the state, total production, production per colony, number of colonies, and price of honey, as well as several other statistics. This code answers several different questions:
1. Do honeybees produce less honey per colony today?
2. Which states produce the most honey?
3. What is the distribution in the number of colonies at sights in the top 6 beekeeping states?
4. How has the price of honey changed over time?
5. How has the total production changed over time?
6. How many colonies are there now?
7. How has the value of production changed over time?

This code primarily uses pandas and plotnine to rearrange and visualize the data. 
The output of this code is given in the ipnb file, which allows the viewer to see the code and its output together. 

This code could be used to analyze future data on bees, and to help project honey projected production in different states.
